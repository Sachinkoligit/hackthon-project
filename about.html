                    A local community is defined as a group of people living in a common area in which intent, resources, needs, and risks are shared. Being part of these groups promotes kinship and provides more space to connect with others. Due to these shared factors, the members often have a common language, beliefs, and stories that they pass throughout ages. A strong local community makes its members more active and pushes each one to work toward a common goal, which is progress.
                    Since these groups are composed of people with various backgrounds, problems are inevitable. Issues may start from families and further grow as a community matter. It is crucial to solve each problem to avoid a bigger uproar.<br><br>
